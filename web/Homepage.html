          My Name is Jake Muhlestein. I live in Idaho Fall, ID with my wife, Kim, and 3 kids, Jaxon (8), Parker(7), Kyler (4). I am currently going to school for a Computer Programing associates Degree. I Graduated from BYU-Idaho in 2011 with a Bachelor's in Accounting. I love gaming and out doors but don't get to do too much of that while I'm in school. Something unique about my family is that Parker was born at 22 weeks gestation, was in the NICU for 4 and a half months, and at the age of 7 is pretty much like any other 7 year old. Such a miracle!
